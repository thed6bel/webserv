# Webserv Project
## About the Project
The Webserv project was developed as part of the curriculum at S19. It is a C++ implementation of a web server that handles HTTP requests according to the HTTP protocol standards. This server supports essential features such as processing GET, POST and DELETE requests, managing multiple simultaneous connections, and interpreting HTTP headers.

## Features
GET, POST and DELETE Requests Handling: Ability to receive and respond to basic web requests.
Multi-client Support: Uses multi-threading programming to handle multiple clients at the same time.
HTTP Headers Parsing: Extracts and utilizes information contained in HTTP headers.
Technologies Used:

#### **C++98 and C:** The project is primarily written in C++98, with some parts using C for functions allowed in the project.
#### **Unix Systems:** Developed and tested on Unix-based systems.
## Testing Tools
A basic website is included to thoroughly test all aspects of the server's functionality and to ensure comprehensive evaluation during the correction process.

## Installation
To install and run the Webserv on your local machine, follow these steps:

bash
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thed6bel/webserv
cd webserv
make run
```

## Project Achievement
